    "Chapter 12 : Third Party Libraries\n",
    "=============================\n",
    "_____________________________\n",
    "There are many libraries written by others available for Python on PYPI - Python Package Index (https://pypi.python.org/pypi), consisting of packages or modules, that implement many features beyond the standard library .\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, the libraries are distributed in the following ways :\n",
    "\n",
    "+ *distutils* packages.\n",
    "+ Package managers from operating system.\n",
    "+ Installers.\n",
    "+ Python Eggs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Distutils / Setup tools\n",
    "\n",
    "Packages using *distutils* module, which is distributed with Python, are very popular. The packages are distributed in compressed files (usually \".tar.gz\" , \".tar.bz2\" or \".zip \" ). To install , you must unzip the file , go into the folder that was unzipped , and to execute the command:\n",
    "\n",
    "    python setup.py install\n",
    "    \n",
    "The package will be installed in \"site-packages\" folder in Python .\n",
    "\n",
    "Installer programs are nothing more than executables that install the library. They are generally used in Windows environment and can be uninstalled from the Control Panel.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Eggs\n",
    "\n",
    "Egg is a Python package format (with the extension \".egg\") which is administered by easy_install utility, which is part of the project [setuptools](http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/setuptools/). \n",
    "\n",
    "The program finds the newest version of the package in [PYPI](http://pypi.python.org/pypi) (*Python Package Index*), the Python package repository, and also tries to install dependencies as needed .\n",
    "\n",
    "Python Egg packages can be installed via the command:\n",
    "\n",
    "    easy_install package_name\n",
    "\n",
    "The easy_install *script* is installed in the \"scripts\" folder of Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### PIP and Python Wheels\n",
    "The Python distributions with version 3.4 and higher are using an integrated library/package manager PIP, replacing the need for Distutils or SetupTools.\n",
    "\n",
    "Running a simple command will \n",
    "\n",
    "    pip3 install package_name\n",
    "    \n",
    "downloads the package from PYPI and install it on the system including all the dependencies....\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Wheels\n",
    "\n",
    "Wheels are the new standard of python distribution and are intended to replace eggs. Support is offered in pip >= 1.4 and setuptools >= 0.8.\n",
    "\n",
    "    pip3 install wheel_name\n",
    "\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "### Pre-compiled packages for Windows\n",
    "There is a un-official repository of precompiled python wheels for plenty of modules\n",
    "\n",
    "http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### System Package Manager for Linux OS\n",
    "\n",
    "Package managers from operating System, usually work with their own packet formats, like \".deb\" (Ubuntu / Debian Linux) or \".rpm\" (RedHat Linux). How to install the packages depends on the manager. The big advantage is that the package manager takes care of dependencies and updates.\n"
